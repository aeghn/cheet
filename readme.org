This is a little bash script for querying cheatsheets with fzf.

* Usage
** Browse
   Just type the keyword and look at the preview.
   I spilt an entry into four parts, they are: app/command name, argument/keybinding, description and note. I suggest to use offical help to fill description part and insert the note part with your own understanding.

** Add
   Hit =<C-l>= and go to the editor page.
   
   You can add more than one entry at a time, and starting from the first line after empty or %%.*%% lines, every four lines are a group, which are the program(command), argument(keybinding), description and notes in order.

** Edit
*** Edit one entry
	Hit =<C-o>= and you will go into the editor page to edit current entry. The entry would be split into four lines.
	
	The old entry would be backed up at HISTORY_FILE( Default: =$HOME/.cache/cheet_histfile= ).

*** Edit all entries
	Hit =<C-i>= and go to the editor page. You can directly edit the cheatsheet file here.
** Format
   Hit =<C-r>= to format entries.
   The lines beginning with DELIMITER will be sorted, the other lines will be put at the tail of sheet.
